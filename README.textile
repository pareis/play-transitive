h1. [transitive] Transitive Persistence for play 1.2.x

_This module brings back transitive JPA persistence that has been removed from play_

h2. Rationale

The founders of the play framework have made a decision against the
implicit, transitive persistence model that is found in JPA.

The solution they built requires the developer to explicitly call save() on
any object that has change (they propagate down the cascade chain so it's a little mitigated).
